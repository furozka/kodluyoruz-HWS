[16,21,11,8,12,22] -> Merge sort 

Write Merge Sort stages:

Stage 1: [16,21,11] [8,12,22]
Stage 2: [16,21] [11] [8,12] [22]
Stage 3: [16] [21] [11] [8] [12] [22]
Stage 4: [16,21] [8,11] [12,22]
Stage 5: [8,11,16,21] [12,22]
Stage 6: [8,11,12,16,21,22]

Write time complexity:

For every stage n action happens and in every stage logn action happens so

Time complexity = O(nlogn)
